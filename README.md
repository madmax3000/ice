![N|Solid](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/madmax3000/ice/master/ice%20logo.jpg)


Intelligent Circuit Enhancer  (ICE)  is an Circuit optimization tool developed in python with focus on power electronic circuits.
#  Features! 
  - Simple  python based optimizer which makes easy it run on cloud platforms like google colab
  - Pseudo-drawing with the help of python Power Electronic Simulator makes it removes the issues with netlist based circuit representation and makes it easy to run in cloud platforms
# Supported algorithms:
- NSGAII
- NSGAIII
- CMAES
- GDE3
- IBEA
- MOEAD
- OMOPSO
- SMPSO
- SPEA2
- EpsMOEA






### Tech behind ICE

ICE uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [Python Power Electronics](https://www.pythonpowerelectronics.com/) - The simulator used in this software
* [platypus-opt](https://github.com/Project-Platypus/Platypus) - multi-objective optimization tool
* [numpy](https://www.numpy.org/) - scientific computing library
* [scipy](https://scipy.org/scipylib/) -  open-source software for mathematics, science, and engineering. 
* [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) - Flexible and powerful data analysis / manipulation library for Python
* [matlibplot](https://matplotlib.org/) - Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.


### Installation

ICE requires python 3.7+ to run.

### General Instructions for users
- Ability to use the simulator Python Power Electronics is required to operate this software
- Basic knowledge in python is very helpful in case of Dynamic Circuit Design
- Basic electrical engineering knowledge is required for the user.

### For help with the simulator:
Here are some resources
* [Python Power Electronics](https://www.pythonpowerelectronics.com/) - This is the official website of the simulator. We use a modified version in our software.You can find a a lot of tutorials and case studies in this website.
* [Python Power Electronics tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxVbKNK18A_a9Ohd0Kb7kNA) - This is a YouTube channel from Dr. Shivkumar V. Iyer the creator of Python Power Electronics. It has a lot of free materials.
* [Python Power Electronics course](https://www.udemy.com/course/simulating-power-electronic-circuits-using-python/) - This is a paid online course by from Dr. Shivkumar V. Iyer the creator of Python Power Electronics on udemy

### Future plans

 - Create more Tutorials
 - Convert to Cython for faster running
 - Provide support for more Circuit Simulators
