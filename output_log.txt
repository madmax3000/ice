The data in the output file is as follows: 
Time Ammeter-1D0 Ammeter-1N0 Ammeter-5V0 Voltmeter-7C0 Voltmeter-7Y0 
 
For plotting using Gnuplot, a sample command will be: 
plot 'ckt_output.dat' u 1:2 w l 
This will plot column 2 with respect to time. 
 
plot 'ckt_output.dat' u 1:2 w l,'' u 1:3 w l 
This will plot columns 2 and 3 with respect to time.
